Hello everyone.
This is Gourav Das.I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology degree in Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology,Burla in the department of Electronics and Telecommunication engineering.
I belong from Jagatsinghpur.
I am very fond of coding and I think that everything in this world can be coded and developed to produce a desirable output.

Git is a platform where various coders and developers change existing software for a better tomorrow. And the changes can be tracked down also.

Thanks.
